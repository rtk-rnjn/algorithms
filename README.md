## How to run?

There is nothing to run. Just for the fun purpose there exists a [`main.py`](main.py) file, which runs a web server on your local machine. You can run it by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine and required dependencies are installed. You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
